# Ground Control Point (GCP) Marker Detection module for python 

A convolutional neural network pretrained on MNIST dataset was used. The
final layer with 10 classes was replaced with a layer having two output
classes. Accuracy is about 93 %. 

(network architecture:
https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist\_cnn.py)

Class 1: Marker

Class 2: Non Marker

 ## How to use: 

-   Clone this repository to your local working directory.

-   First run setup.sh file in your Linux machine ( \$bash setup.sh)

-   This will install the required dependencies such as tensorflow and
    Keras. You might want to check before if you have installed these
    two (tensorflow and Keras) already. Because it might cause conflict
    between different versions.

-   Now you can import classifier module using import statement (import
    classifier). Instantiate a classifier object and then use classify
    method for classifying images. Make sure the images are of the
    specified dimensions (28 \* 28).

## Examples of positive and negative classes:

Positives: (class 1) check in class1 directory

Negatives: (class 2) check in class2 directory
